# discod-rng-bot
A Javascript Discord bot using Discord.js to make commands available in your server to randomly pick things.
This script requires the Discord.js, dotenv, and fs node packages. Please make sure they are installed before launching your bot.
Also, make sure to create a '.env' file with 'TOKEN=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN' and 'PREFIX=YOUR_PREFIX' entries in the root of the folder.
Replace YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN with your bot's auth token and replace YOUR_PREFIX with your chosen prefix (mine was '!').
